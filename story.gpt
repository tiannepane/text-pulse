1. Open the webpage at ${url} and go through the content to understand its main points.
2. Summarize the content into a concise text suitable for an Instagram reel or TikTok video, keeping it under 100 words and free of emojis.
3. Divide the summarized text into three sections and save each section as a text file in the format: ${dir}/story-${INDEX}.txt.
4. For each section of the text, think of a descriptive keyword or phrase to create a 1024x1792 b-roll image. Save these images as ${dir}/b-roll-${INDEX}.png.
5. Convert each section of text into an audio file and save them as ${dir}/voiceover-${INDEX}, relying on the default file format.
6. Perform speech-to-text conversion on all the .mp3 files in ${dir}, saving the transcription for each file in separate files located at ${dir}.
